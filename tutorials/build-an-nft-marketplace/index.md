# Build an NFT marketplace DApp like OpenSea

Building an NFT marketplace DApp like Opensea with Solidity and Javascript/React may be an important step in your web3 development journey. Let's go.

In my previous tutorials, you may have learned:

- how to write a smart contract and run it on local blockchain testnet using hardhat.

- how to build a full-stack DApp which means deal with all three parts of a DApp: smart contract, web app and user's wallet.

- how to unit test, deploy to public testnet, verify smart contract on block explorer Etherscan.

Now you can start writing a smart contract with complete functionalities: **a marketplace for digital items**. NFT items of an NFT collection are the digital items traded here.

Nader Dabit wrote two versions of [How to Build a Full Stack NFT Marketplace - V2 (2022)](https://dev.to/dabit3/building-scalable-full-stack-apps-on-ethereum-with-polygon-2cfb). Inspired by his idea and based on his smart contract codebase, I write more code and write this tutorial for you.

You may already read my previous tutorials. If not, I suggest you read the following two as I will not explain some tactics which are already there.

Let's start building.
